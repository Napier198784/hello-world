# hello-world
Pre-work for ky code-you program acceptance 
I am extremely interested in becoming more knowledgeable in regards to technology for a couple of reasons which are: it offers employees a very confidante yearly salary. Also because it's always been something I've wanted to learn. my little brother can do just about anything when it comes to computers but he would never teach me anything, so I've dedicated some time to trying to learn some stuff on my own..... which brings me here.
